## Me

I'm a Chinese, live in the Chengdu of Sichuan Province.
It is a place which is famous for the home of precious animal -- panda.

Now I'm a programmer, an engineer in the corporation of [JD](https://www.joybuy.com/).
Except writing program codes, I like to write blogs in my spare time.
Sometimes I also translate some good articles for practicing my English and share them to my friends and readers.
