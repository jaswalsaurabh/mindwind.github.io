## The origin of the name
From 1998 to 2008, I had a crush on two games [StarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc) and [WarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/war3). One day I became a professional programmer, spent more and more time on programming, not gaming. I miss deeply those past days of playing [StarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc/) and [WarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/war3/),
so I name this project with 'Craft' for commemorating past days.
More importantly, I hope this project will inherit the spirit of the two craft games.


   > The pursuit of perfection and high quality.


## The philosophy of design
```minimal``` Minimal code and dependency.  
```atomic``` Just do one thing right for every component.  
```compositional``` Compose atomic components for complex function.


## The ideal
```One hour``` Less than one hour, you can use and understand it easily following the guide.  
```One day``` Less than one day, you can dive into source code and master it.
