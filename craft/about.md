## The origin of the name
From 1998 to 2008, i have a crush on two games [StarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc)
and [WarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/war3).
One day i became a professional programmer, i spent more and more time on programming not gaming.
I miss deeply those [StarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc/)
or [WarCraft](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/war3/) past days,
so i use the 'Craft' to naming this project to commemorate past days.
More importantly, i hope this project to inherit the spirit of the two craft games.


   > The pursuit of perfection and high quality.
